# React redux todo app

This is the result from this [repo](https://github.com/chrisblakely01/react-redux-todo-app).
Probably it is not exactly as it is in original code source due I tried to complete it on my own first and then I watched the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiesH6WU63I&ab_channel=ChrisBlakely) any way is workingðŸ˜Ž.
 
 
Excellent tutorial helped me to got a better understood on how to implement toolkit. 

ðŸ‘‰Next step it to keep going with the second part : use thunk to consume an API ðŸ’ª.



## Running the finished code

Clone the repo and run the following:

- cd final
- npm install
- npm start

**NOTE:** The API must be running in order for the finished code to work as intended. Seee "Running the API" below

## Running the starter code

The starter code is located in its own folder. To get it:

- cd starter
- npm install
- npm start

## Running the API

The API is a dead basic node.js/express server. Clone the repo and run the following:

- cd api
- npm install
- npm run server
- check its running by going to browser/postman

```
localhost:7000/todos

```
